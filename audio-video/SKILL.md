# Audio and Video in Decentraland

## When to Use Which Media Component

| Need                                                  | Component                                | Key Difference                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Sound effect from a file (click, explosion, footstep) | `AudioSource`                            | Local file, spatial, one-shot or looping |
| Background music or radio stream                      | `AudioStream`                            | External URL, non-spatial, continuous    |
| Video on a surface (screen, billboard)                | `VideoPlayer` + `Material.Texture.Video` | Requires a mesh to display on            |

**Decision flow:**

1. Is it a local audio file? → `AudioSource`
2. Is it a streaming URL (radio, live audio)? → `AudioStream`
3. Is it video content? → `VideoPlayer` on a plane/mesh

## Audio Source (Sound Effects & Music)

Play audio clips from files:

```typescript
import { engine, Transform, AudioSource } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { Vector3 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

const speaker = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(speaker, { position: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8) })

AudioSource.create(speaker, {
	audioClipUrl: 'assets/scene/Audio/music.mp3',
	playing: true,
	loop: true,
	volume: 0.5, // 0 to 1
	pitch: 1.0, // Playback speed (0.5 = half speed, 2.0 = double)
})
```

### Supported Formats

- `.mp3` (recommended)
- `.ogg`
- `.wav`

### File Organization

```
project/
├── assets/
│   └── scene/
│       └── Audio/
│           ├── click.mp3
│           ├── background-music.mp3
│           └── explosion.ogg
├── src/
│   └── index.ts
└── scene.json
```

### Play/Stop/Toggle

```typescript
// Play
AudioSource.getMutable(speaker).playing = true

// Stop
AudioSource.getMutable(speaker).playing = false

// Toggle
const audio = AudioSource.getMutable(speaker)
audio.playing = !audio.playing
```

### Play on Click

```typescript
import { pointerEventsSystem, InputAction } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

const button = engine.addEntity()
// ... set up transform and mesh ...

const audioEntity = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(audioEntity, { position: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8) })
AudioSource.create(audioEntity, {
	audioClipUrl: 'assets/scene/Audio/click.mp3',
	playing: false,
	loop: false,
	volume: 0.8,
})

pointerEventsSystem.onPointerDown(
	{
		entity: button,
		opts: { button: InputAction.IA_POINTER, hoverText: 'Play sound' },
	},
	() => {
		// Reset and play
		const audio = AudioSource.getMutable(audioEntity)
		audio.playing = false
		audio.playing = true
	}
)
```

## Audio Streaming

Stream audio from a URL (radio, live streams).

> **Before adding a streaming URL:** If the URL wasn't provided by the user, confirm the source before adding it — e.g., "I'd reference the stream at [URL]. Is that the source you want?" See `agent-behaviors.md` in `overview/` for the full confirmation pattern.

```typescript
import { engine, Transform, AudioStream } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { Vector3 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

const radio = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(radio, { position: Vector3.create(8, 1, 8) })

AudioStream.create(radio, {
	url: 'https://example.com/stream.mp3',
	playing: true,
	volume: 0.3,
})
```

### AudioStream State

Query the current state of an audio stream with `AudioStream.getAudioState` and the `MediaState` enum — useful for reacting to buffering, errors, or end-of-stream:

```typescript
import { AudioStream, MediaState } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

const state = AudioStream.getAudioState(radio)
if (state === MediaState.MS_PLAYING) {
	console.log('Stream is playing')
} else if (state === MediaState.MS_ERROR) {
	console.log('Stream error occurred')
}

// Monitor state changes in a system
let lastState: MediaState | undefined = undefined
engine.addSystem(() => {
	const current = AudioStream.getAudioState(radio)
	if (lastState !== current) {
		console.log('Stream state changed:', current)
		lastState = current
	}
})
```

## Video Player

Play video on a surface. If the video URL wasn't provided by the user, confirm before referencing it (same pattern as audio streams above).

```typescript
import {
	engine,
	Transform,
	VideoPlayer,
	Material,
	MeshRenderer,
} from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'
import { Vector3 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

// Create a screen
const screen = engine.addEntity()
Transform.create(screen, {
	position: Vector3.create(8, 3, 15.9),
	scale: Vector3.create(8, 4.5, 1), // 16:9 ratio
})
MeshRenderer.setPlane(screen)

// Add video player
VideoPlayer.create(screen, {
	src: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
	playing: true,
	loop: true,
	volume: 0.5,
	playbackRate: 1.0,
	position: 0, // Start time in seconds
})

// Create video texture
const videoTexture = Material.Texture.Video({ videoPlayerEntity: screen })

// Basic material (recommended — better performance)
Material.setBasicMaterial(screen, {
	texture: videoTexture,
})
```

### Video Controls

```typescript
// Play
VideoPlayer.getMutable(screen).playing = true

// Pause
VideoPlayer.getMutable(screen).playing = false

// Change volume
VideoPlayer.getMutable(screen).volume = 0.8

// Change source
VideoPlayer.getMutable(screen).src = 'https://example.com/other.mp4'
```

### Enhanced Video Material (PBR)

Ideally video screens should use basic (unlit) materials, that way they're always bright and crisp.

```typescript
const videoTexture = Material.Texture.Video({ videoPlayerEntity: screen })

Material.setBasicMaterial(screen, {
	texture: videoTexture,
})
```

For a brighter, emissive video screen:

```typescript
import { Color3 } from '@dcl/sdk/math'

const videoTexture = Material.Texture.Video({ videoPlayerEntity: screen })
Material.setPbrMaterial(screen, {
	texture: videoTexture,
	roughness: 1.0,
	specularIntensity: 0,
	metallic: 0,
	emissiveTexture: videoTexture,
	emissiveIntensity: 0.6,
	emissiveColor: Color3.White(),
})
```

### Video Events

Monitor video playback state:

```typescript
import { videoEventsSystem, VideoState } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

videoEventsSystem.registerVideoEventsEntity(screen, (videoEvent) => {
	switch (videoEvent.state) {
		case VideoState.VS_PLAYING:
			console.log('Video started playing')
			break
		case VideoState.VS_PAUSED:
			console.log('Video paused')
			break
		case VideoState.VS_READY:
			console.log('Video ready to play')
			break
		case VideoState.VS_ERROR:
			console.log('Video error occurred')
			break
	}
})
```

## Spatial Audio

Audio from the `AudioSource` component in Decentraland is **spatial by default** — it gets louder as the player approaches the audio source entity and quieter as they move away. The position is determined by the entity's `Transform`. You can change this by setting the `global` property to true.

```typescript
AudioSource.create(sourceEntity, {
	audioClipUrl: 'assets/scene/Audio/music.mp3',
	playing: true,
	global: true,
})
```

Audio from the `VideoPlayer` component and the `AudioStream` component is global by default. Set it to spatial by setting the `spatial` to true. You can also change these properties:

- spatialMinDistance: The minimum distance at which audio becomes spatial. If the player is closer, the audio will be heard at full volume. 0 by default.

- spatialMaxDistance: The maximum distance at which the audio is heard. If the player is further away, the audio will be heard at 0 volume. 60 by default

```typescript
VideoPlayer.create(videoPlayerEntity, {
	src: 'https://player.vimeo.com/progressive_redirect/playback/1145666916/rendition/540p/file.mp4%20%28540p%29.mp4?loc=external&signature=db1cd6946851313cb8f7be60d1f6c30af0902bcc46fdae0ba2a06e5fdf44c329',
	playing: true,
	spatial: true,
	spatialMinDistance: 5,
	spatialMaxDistance: 10,
})

AudioStream.create(audioStreamEntity, {
	url: 'https://radioislanegra.org/listen/up/stream',
	playing: true,
	volume: 1.0,
	spatial: true,
	spatialMinDistance: 5,
	spatialMaxDistance: 10,
})
```

## Free Audio Files

Always check the audio catalog before creating placeholder sound file references. It contains 50 free sounds from the Creator Hub asset packs.

Read `{baseDir}/references/audio-catalog.md` for music tracks (ambient, dance, medieval, sci-fi, etc.), ambient sounds (birds, city, factory, etc.), interaction sounds (buttons, doors, levers, chests), sound effects (explosions, sirens, bells), and game mechanic sounds (win/lose, heal, respawn, damage).

To use a catalog sound:

```bash
# Download from catalog
mkdir -p assets/scene/Audio
curl -o assets/scene/Audio/ambient_1.mp3 "https://builder-items.decentraland.org/contents/bafybeic4faewxkdqx67dloyw57ikgaeibc2e2dbx34hwjubl3gfvs2r4su"
```

```typescript
// Reference in code — must be a local file path
AudioSource.create(entity, {
	audioClipUrl: 'assets/scene/Audio/ambient_1.mp3',
	playing: true,
	loop: true,
})
```

### How to suggest audio

1. Read the audio catalog file
2. Search for sounds matching the user's description/theme
3. Suggest specific sounds with download commands
4. Download selected sounds into the scene's `assets/scene/Audio/` directory
5. Reference them in code with local paths

> **Important**: `AudioSource` only works with **local files**. Never use external URLs for the `audioClipUrl` field. Always download audio into `assets/scene/Audio/` first.

### Video State Polling

Check video playback state programmatically:

```typescript
import { videoEventsSystem, VideoState } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

engine.addSystem(() => {
	const state = videoEventsSystem.getVideoState(videoEntity)
	if (state) {
		console.log('Video state:', state.state) // VideoState.VS_PLAYING, VS_PAUSED, etc.
		console.log('Current time:', state.currentOffset)
	}
})
```

### Audio Playback Events

Use the `AudioEvent` component to detect audio state changes:

```typescript
import { AudioEvent } from '@dcl/sdk/ecs'

engine.addSystem(() => {
	const event = AudioEvent.getOrNull(audioEntity)
	if (event) {
		console.log('Audio state:', event.state) // playing, paused, finished
	}
})
```

### Permission for External Media

External audio/video URLs require the `ALLOW_MEDIA_HOSTNAMES` permission in scene.json:

```json
{
	"requiredPermissions": ["ALLOW_MEDIA_HOSTNAMES"],
	"allowedMediaHostnames": ["stream.example.com", "cdn.example.com"]
}
```

### Multiple Video Surfaces

Share one VideoPlayer across multiple screens by referencing the same `videoPlayerEntity`:

```typescript
Material.setPbrMaterial(screen1, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Video({ videoPlayerEntity: videoEntity }),
})
Material.setPbrMaterial(screen2, {
	texture: Material.Texture.Video({ videoPlayerEntity: videoEntity }),
})
```

### Play a video on a glTF model

You may want to play a video on a shape that is not a primitive, to have curved screens or exotic shapes. Use `GltfNodeModifiers` to swap the material of a GLTF model.

```typescript
VideoPlayer.create(myEntity, {
	src: 'https://player.vimeo.com/external/552481870.m3u8?s=c312c8533f97e808fccc92b0510b085c8122a875',
	playing: true,
})

GltfNodeModifiers.create(myEntity, {
	modifiers: [
		{
			path: '',
			material: {
				material: {
					$case: 'pbr',
					pbr: {
						texture: Material.Texture.Video({
							videoPlayerEntity: myEntity,
						}),
					},
				},
			},
		},
	],
})
```

### Video Limits & Tips

- **Simultaneous videos**: Always avoid playing multiple videos at once. Only play more than 1 simultaneous video if explicitly requested. Maximum 5 simultaneous videos.
- **Distance-based control**: Pause video when player is far away to save bandwidth
- **Supported formats**: `.mp4` (H.264), `.webm`, HLS (`.m3u8`) for live streaming
- **Live streaming**: Use HLS (`.m3u8`) URLs — most reliable across clients

For full component field details, supported formats, and advanced patterns, see `{baseDir}/references/media-reference.md`.

## Important Notes

- Audio files must be in the project's directory (relative paths from project root)
- Video requires HTTPS URLs — HTTP won't work
- Players must interact with the scene (click) before audio can play (browser autoplay policy)
- Keep audio files small — large files increase scene load time
- Use `.mp3` for music and `.ogg` for sound effects (smaller file sizes)
- For live video streaming, use HLS (.m3u8) URLs when possible
- If an audio file needs to be ready to play as the player interacts, use the `AssetLoad` component to pre-load the asset.
